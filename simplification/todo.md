# simplifying docs

restart the whole process again (less docs overall, lose installing and managing apps pages and only link to upstream project pages)

- less links
- less words
- remove the handheld wiki
- edit any weird goofs that appear in a text editor when viewing it
- update docs that need to be updated

PR new documentation changes every month.
